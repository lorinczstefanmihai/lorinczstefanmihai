👋 Hi, I’m Stefan

I’m a Mechatronics Engineer passionate about building reliable, efficient, and secure embedded systems. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, structured solutions.
My personal motto:

✨ “Even a system with an LED can be simple or complex.”

 What I Do 💻⚙️

• Embedded software in C/C++

• Experience with microcontrollers: STM32, ESP32, NXP, Infineon, ARM Cortex-A8 (BeagleBone)

• Automotive systems (AUTOSAR, ISO 26262, UDS, CAN, diagnostics)

• Device drivers, real-time control, hardware–software integration

• IoT systems, communication protocols, connectivity

• Debugging with oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, TRACE32, CANoe

• Building modular, testable, and maintainable embedded architectures

I like solving important and complex tasks by breaking them down, starting simple, and building scalable solutions.
