👋 Hi, I’m Stefan Lorincz

I’m a Mechatronics Engineer passionate about building reliable, efficient, and secure embedded systems. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, structured solutions.
My personal motto:

✨ “Even a system with an LED can be simple or complex.”

What I Do

⚙️ Embedded software development (C/C++, STM32, ESP32, RTOS)

🚗 Automotive systems (AUTOSAR, ISO 26262, UDS, CAN, diagnostics)

🔧 Device drivers, real-time control, hardware–software integration

🌐 IoT systems, connectivity, and automation

🧪 Debugging with oscilloscopes, TRACE32, CANoe, JTAG

🛠️ Building modular, testable, maintainable embedded architectures

I like solving important and complex tasks by breaking them down, starting simple, and building scalable solutions.
